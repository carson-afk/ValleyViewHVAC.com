      { q: 'How often should I service my AC?', a: 'Once a year is the industry standard. Salem-area homes with heavy pollen or wildfire smoke exposure benefit from twice-yearly service.' },
      { q: 'Will tune-ups really save money?', a: 'Yes. A properly maintained AC uses 15–40% less energy than a neglected one and lasts 5+ years longer. The tune-up cost pays back within the first summer.' },

      { q: 'How much does an AC repair cost?', a: 'Typical residential AC repairs range from $180 (capacitor replacement) to $1,200 (compressor hard-start, evap coil clean + recharge). Our estimator gives a more specific range once you pick the symptom.' },
      { q: 'Do you charge for diagnostics?', a: "Yes — $149 flat diagnostic fee, but it's applied in full toward your repair cost if you approve the work. You only pay the diagnostic if you decline to repair." },

    bullets: [
      { t: 'Why duct leakage matters', b: 'Industry studies show the average home loses 20–30% of conditioned air through duct leaks. For a Salem home with a $250/month summer electric bill, that can mean $50–75 of pure waste every month.' },
      { t: 'When to clean ducts', b: "After a renovation, if you notice visible dust buildup at registers, after water damage, or if someone in the home has severe allergies. We don't recommend duct cleaning on a set schedule — only when there's a reason." },
      { t: 'Aeroseal — seal leaks without tearing apart walls', b: 'Aeroseal pressurizes your duct system and injects a polymer aerosol that seals leaks from the inside. Installed in 4–8 hours, certified result, no drywall demolition required.' },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'Do I really need my ducts cleaned?', a: 'Not on a schedule — only when you have a specific issue (renovation dust, mold, severe allergies, visible buildup). Most HVAC contractors over-recommend cleaning; we only sell it when it actually helps.' },
      { q: 'Does duct cleaning help allergies?', a: 'Sometimes. If dust, pet dander, or mold spores are living in your ducts, yes. If the allergen is pollen from outside, duct cleaning does less than a MERV 13+ filter.' },
      { q: 'How much does duct sealing cost?', a: 'Aeroseal for a typical 2,000 sqft home runs $1,500–$2,800 and pays back in 3–5 years through lower energy bills. Spot-sealing specific leaks runs $300–$900.' },

    bullets: [
      { t: 'Gas furnace vs. heat pump — what we recommend in Salem', b: 'Salem winters are mild enough that modern cold-climate heat pumps deliver heat down to 5°F at good efficiency. For most homes we recommend a heat pump paired with a small electric or gas backup rather than a traditional gas furnace — lower lifetime cost and rebate-eligible.' },
      { t: 'Combustion analysis matters', b: 'A furnace that looks fine can produce high CO at the register — we test every install with a calibrated analyzer and document the numbers. This is the single biggest safety + efficiency check most contractors skip.' },
      { t: 'Financing and rebates', b: "Energy Trust of Oregon rebates, federal tax credits, and our Enhancify financing partner mean most furnace upgrades can start with $0 down and a fixed monthly payment." },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'How long does a furnace last?', a: 'A well-maintained gas furnace lasts 15–20 years. Heat pumps last 12–15 years. An electric furnace can push 20–25 years. When yours hits 12+ years and needs a significant repair, replacement usually makes economic sense.' },
      { q: 'Should I replace AC and furnace together?', a: "If either is 10+ years old and you're replacing one, replacing both together saves 15–25% on the combined install (one service trip, shared labor) and ensures matched efficiency between the systems." },
      { q: 'What size furnace do I need?', a: "Manual-J load calc is the only right way to size. We measure your home's heat loss, not just square feet. Oversized furnaces short-cycle, over-dry your air, and cost more to run." },

    bullets: [
      { t: 'Why safety matters more than convenience', b: "A cracked heat exchanger can leak carbon monoxide into your home — slowly, invisibly, and lethally. Combustion analysis detects this before your CO alarm does. We've flagged cracked exchangers on three Salem homes this year alone." },
      { t: "What's actually included", b: 'Full 27-point inspection including electrical, mechanical, and combustion checks. We document every measurement so you can compare year-over-year and catch trends before they become failures.' },
      { t: 'Member priority', b: 'Maintenance plan members get priority dispatch during winter cold snaps — when every HVAC company in the Willamette Valley is backed up 3–5 days, members skip the line.' },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'When should I schedule fall maintenance?', a: 'September through early November is ideal. Schedule before the first cold snap — once temperatures drop below freezing, every HVAC company in the Valley gets slammed and routine tune-ups push to December.' },
      { q: 'What does a tune-up cost?', a: '$149 for a full 27-point inspection, or $249 for the combined spring AC + fall furnace annual plan with priority dispatch and 10% repair discounts.' },
      { q: 'Do gas furnaces really need combustion analysis?', a: "Yes. It's the only way to catch a cracked heat exchanger, improper gas pressure, or partial blockage in the flue — all of which can produce dangerous CO levels. Any HVAC company that skips this is doing you a disservice." },

      { t: 'What we fix vs. recommend replacing', b: "Small repairs on a younger furnace (under 10 years): fix it. Major repairs on an older system (heat exchanger crack, compressor failure, control board on a 15-year-old unit): replacement usually saves money within 2–3 years." },
      { t: 'Safety first', b: "If there's any suspicion of a cracked heat exchanger or CO leak, we red-tag the system and shut down the gas supply until it's repaired or replaced. We don't operate with CO risk — full stop." },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'My furnace is making a loud bang when it starts. What is it?', a: 'Usually delayed ignition — gas builds up for a second before the ignitor fires. Common causes: dirty burners, misaligned flame sensor, low gas pressure. We diagnose it on-site in 15 minutes.' },
      { q: 'How much does a furnace repair cost?', a: 'Common repairs run $200 (flame sensor) to $1,400 (control board + blower motor). The estimator on our site gives a range once you describe the symptom.' },
      { q: 'Should I just buy a new furnace?', a: "Depends on age and repair cost. Under 10 years old + small repair: fix it. Over 15 years + major repair: replace. 10–15 + moderate repair: we'll walk you through the math." },

      { t: 'Why heat pumps make sense in Salem', b: 'Salem winters rarely drop below 20°F — well within the efficient range of modern cold-climate heat pumps. For typical Salem homes, switching from gas heat to a heat pump cuts heating costs 30–50% and adds central AC for free.' },
      { t: 'Ductless vs. central — when each wins', b: "Ductless wins: older homes without ducts, room additions, garage conversions, ADUs, tasting rooms. Central wins: newer homes with existing duct work in good condition, whole-home retrofits, budget priority." },
      { t: 'Rebates make heat pumps surprisingly affordable', b: "Energy Trust of Oregon: up to $2,000. Federal tax credit: up to $2,000. Utility bonus rebates: up to $500. Combined, most Salem heat-pump installs see $3,000–$4,500 off sticker price." },

      { q: 'Can I replace a boiler with a heat pump?', a: "Sometimes — depends on the building's distribution (radiator vs. forced air) and electrical capacity. Hydronic boiler → hydronic heat-pump retrofits exist but require careful design. We'll walk you through feasibility in a free consultation." },
      { q: 'Do commercial heat pumps work in cold weather?', a: 'Yes — modern commercial cold-climate heat pumps maintain capacity down to 0°F, well below Salem winter lows.' },
      { q: 'What about gas price volatility?', a: "That's exactly why many commercial owners are switching to heat pumps — stable electric pricing and 30–50% lower operating costs hedge against gas price swings." },

    { name:'Tasting Room Owner', city:'McMinnville, OR', rating:5, text:"Installed ductless units in our tasting room — line runs nearly invisible, conditioning is silent, bill matched the quote to the dollar. Best vendor experience we've had in years." },
    { name:'Thomas R.', city:'Stayton, OR', rating:5, text:"I had three quotes. Valley View wasn't the cheapest or the most expensive — they were the only ones who did an actual Manual-J load calc before quoting. Install was flawless and the system runs like a dream." },

    summary: 'Why hiring local — instead of a regional chain or a national brand — usually means faster response, better warranty follow-through, and accountability that matters.',
    body: [
      ['Faster response when you need it', "Local HVAC shops keep their trucks dispatched from a single regional hub. When your furnace quits at 6pm on a Tuesday in December, the difference between a 45-minute response and a 'we'll see you Friday' response is usually whether you picked someone local."],
      ['Real accountability', "Local companies trade on reputation because they only have one community to lose. A national chain can afford to burn a customer in Salem — local shops can't. That economic reality translates into better customer care."],
      ['Warranty claims that actually get handled', "When a install has a problem six months later, local shops want to fix it because you know their name and tell your neighbors. Regional chains often bounce you around a help desk. That's not a theoretical difference — it's the #1 HVAC complaint on Better Business Bureau filings."],
      ['Climate-specific design knowledge', "Salem's long wet winters + increasingly hot summers need equipment sized for THIS climate — not a textbook 'Pacific Northwest' average. Local shops see Willamette Valley homes every day and size accordingly. National chains use regional defaults."],
      ['Community participation', "Local contractors sponsor little league, hire local tradespeople, pay local taxes, and show up at community events. It's not charity — it's how local trades keep their name in the conversation. And that money stays in Salem."],

    body: [
      ['1. Strange smells', "A burning smell on first run of the season is usually dust burn-off — normal. A persistent burning, electrical, or gas smell is not — shut off the furnace immediately and call us."],
      ['2. Unusual noises', "Light whooshing = normal ignition. Banging on startup = delayed ignition (fix it). Grinding = blower bearing failure (fix soon). Boom or loud cracking = heat exchanger issue (shut down immediately)."],
      ['3. Short cycling', "If your furnace runs for 3–5 minutes, shuts off, and restarts five minutes later, something is wrong — typically a dirty flame sensor, clogged filter, overheating limit, or oversized unit. Short cycling wears out components fast."],
      ['4. Inconsistent heating', "Some rooms warm, others cold? Could be duct leakage (fixable), blower issues, zoning problems, or a failing blower motor. All are repairable — but ignoring them stresses the system."],
      ['5. Yellow pilot or burner flame', "A healthy burner flame is crisp blue with a small yellow tip. Mostly yellow flame = incomplete combustion, which produces carbon monoxide. Shut down and call."],
      ['6. Skyrocketing heating bills', "A sudden jump in gas or electric usage (without a weather change) usually means the system is losing efficiency — clogged coil, failing motor, duct leakage, or developing mechanical problem."],
      ['7. Your furnace is over 15 years old', "Average residential gas furnace life: 15–20 years. At 15+ you should start budgeting for replacement. When a significant repair ($800+) hits a 15+ year unit, replacement almost always saves money within 3 years via efficiency gains."],

    body: [
      ['HVAC work is safety-critical', "Gas combustion, high-voltage electrical, refrigerants under pressure, carbon monoxide risk. A $400 savings on an install becomes a $40,000 liability if a CO event happens. Licensed pros carry insurance, follow code, and document safety tests."],
      ['Warranties require licensed installs', "Most equipment manufacturer warranties are void if the installer isn't licensed. A 10-year compressor warranty on an unlicensed install becomes a 'good luck' warranty. That's not a detail — it's a $3,000–$8,000 detail."],
      ['Code compliance and permits', "Oregon requires permits for furnace, AC, and heat-pump installs, with inspector sign-off. Unpermitted work shows up in home sale disclosures, can fail home inspections, and can invalidate homeowner insurance claims."],
      ['Right-sizing matters more than brand', "An oversized AC short-cycles, dehumidifies poorly, and wears out 2–3x faster than a properly sized unit. Pros do Manual-J load calculations; DIY and unlicensed installers guess by square feet. The 'savings' from skipping professional design often burn faster than a lottery ticket."],
      ['Lifecycle cost, not sticker cost', "Pro install + proper sizing + permit + warranty + annual maintenance usually costs 15–25% more than DIY or handyman install — but delivers 40–60% longer equipment life and 20–30% lower operating costs. The math is not close."],
      ['Peace of mind has dollar value', "When something goes wrong on a pro install, you have recourse: licensed, bonded, insured, with a warranty and a phone number. When something goes wrong on a DIY or handyman install, you have a problem."],
